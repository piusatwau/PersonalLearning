**Tritones** and their role in harmony.

### What is a Tritone?
- A **tritone** is an interval spanning three whole tones (hence the name "tri-tone").
- In a 12-tone scale, it equals 6 half-steps (or semitones).
- It sounds particularly dissonant or "unstable," making it powerful in creating tension that resolves in harmony.

#### Example:
- In the key of C, the tritone interval is between **F** and **B**.

### Tritone and Harmony:
Tritones are crucial in Western harmony for their tension and resolution. They often occur in dominant seventh chords and their substitutions.

1. **In Dominant Seventh Chords**:
   - A dominant 7th chord is built on the fifth degree of the scale.
   - Example: G7 (G-B-D-F) in the key of C major.
   - The tritone in G7 lies between **B** (the major third) and **F** (the minor seventh). This tension resolves to the tonic (C).

2. **Tritone Substitution**:
   - The tritone of a dominant 7th chord can be shared with another chord:
     - G7 (G-B-D-F) shares the tritone **B-F** with **Db7** (Db-F-Ab-Cb).
   - Therefore, **G7 can be substituted by Db7**.
   - This substitution adds chromatic movement and spice to chord progressions.
   - Example: Instead of a traditional **G7 → C**, try **Db7 → C**.

3. **Flat-7 Chords**:
   - In your question, you mentioned flat-7 chords (like G7 and Db7).
   - These share the same tritone and are interchangeable in many harmonic contexts.

### Why It Matters:
- The tritone creates drama, tension, and the need for resolution.
- Using tritone substitutions or exploring its presence in chords can enhance harmonic complexity and creativity.
