The "3 H's" — **Hipster, Hacker, and Hustler** — is a popular framework used to describe the ideal trio of co-founders or team members in a startup:

1. **Hipster (Design/Creativity)**  
   - The creative mind and user experience (UX) expert.
   - Focuses on branding, aesthetics, and ensuring the product looks great and is intuitive for users.
   - Responsible for creating a delightful and engaging product experience.

2. **Hacker (Technology/Engineering)**  
   - The tech-savvy builder and problem solver.
   - Handles coding, software development, and infrastructure.
   - Brings technical expertise to turn ideas into working solutions.

3. **Hustler (Business/Sales)**  
   - The business-oriented leader and visionary.
   - Focuses on strategy, marketing, sales, and fundraising.
   - Ensures the product gains traction and finds the right market fit.

Together, this trio represents a balanced startup team that can build, market, and scale a product effectively.
