# Lean Sigma
Also known as **Lean Six Sigma**, is a methodology that combines **Lean principles** and **Six Sigma techniques** to improve processes, enhance quality, and reduce waste. It is widely used across industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and services, to streamline operations and achieve efficiency.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Lean Principles**:
   - Focus on eliminating waste (non-value-added activities) from processes.
   - Emphasize maximizing value for customers with fewer resources.
   - Key types of waste (TIMWOOD): Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects.

2. **Six Sigma**:
   - A data-driven approach to process improvement.
   - Aims to reduce variability and defects to improve quality and reliability.
   - Uses statistical tools to identify, analyze, and solve problems.
   - Follows the DMAIC cycle: **Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control**.

### Benefits of Lean Six Sigma:
- Increased operational efficiency.
- Enhanced customer satisfaction.
- Cost reduction and increased profitability.
- Improved process quality and reliability.
- Encourages a culture of continuous improvement.

### Applications:
Lean Sigma is applied in various fields to:
- Optimize manufacturing processes.
- Streamline patient flow in hospitals.
- Improve software development processes.
- Enhance supply chain efficiency.

### Tools and Techniques:
Some commonly used tools in Lean Sigma include:
- Value Stream Mapping.
- 5S (Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain).
- Kaizen (Continuous Improvement).
- Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram).
- Statistical Process Control (SPC).
