A business's economic moat is a competitive advantage that makes it difficult for competitors to take away its market share or profits. The term was popularized by Warren Buffett. [1]  
Types of economic moats [2]  

• Switching costs: The cost a consumer incurs when switching to a competitor's product or service. This can include time, risk, price, and inconvenience. [2, 3]  
• Network effects: The value of a product or service increases as more people use it. For example, Yelp is successful because people contribute reviews, making it more valuable for others to use. [4, 5]  
• Intangible assets: Proprietary assets that can't be touched but can significantly impact sales. This includes patents, trademarks, brands, and licenses. [6]  
• Low-cost production: A business can have lower operating costs than its competitors. [7, 8]  
• Efficient scale: A business can have a scale advantage over its competitors. [7]  
• Complexity: A business can have unique processes that are difficult to imitate. [9]  
• Protection: A business can use patents, copyrights, trademarks, or operating rights to protect its products. [9]
