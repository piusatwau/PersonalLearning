**Altruism** is the selfless concern for the well-being of others without expecting anything in return. It involves acting in ways that benefit others, even at a personal cost. Altruistic behavior can range from small acts of kindness—like helping a stranger—to more significant sacrifices, such as donating organs or dedicating time to charitable causes.

### Types of Altruism:
1. **Pure Altruism**: Acting solely out of a genuine desire to help others, with no expectation of personal benefit.  
2. **Reciprocal Altruism**: Helping others with the expectation that they may help you in return at some point in the future.  
3. **Biological Altruism**: Behaviors seen in animals (including humans) that promote the survival of others, often relatives, even at the expense of the individual’s own fitness (e.g., a mother protecting her offspring).  
4. **Moral or Ethical Altruism**: Acting based on a moral duty to assist others, often grounded in philosophical or religious beliefs.
